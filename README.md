# Realtime Chat (It's quite self-descriptive!)
Welcome to **Realtime Chat**! As the title suggests, it's pretty self-explanatory. But if you're still curious, here's a quick rundown.

## What is this project?
This is just a personal project I’m working on to practice and learn more about  JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Socket.io and HTML and CSS for the frontend. It is not intended to be a finished product, but rather a playground where I can try new ideas, improve my skills and gain practical experience. Think of it more as a learning experience than a finished app.

## Why was this created?
Well, sometimes the best way to learn is by actually building something. This project is all about experimenting, making mistakes, and figuring things out as I go. It's not about perfection—it's about learning, having fun, and improving along the way.

## Features
- Chat rooms functionality.
- Management of users entering and leaving rooms.
- Ability to create new rooms or join existing ones.
- And of course, the ability to send messages in the chat rooms!
