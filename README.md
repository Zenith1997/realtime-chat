# 🗨️ Realtime Chat – A Simple, Self-Descriptive Chat App
Welcome to **Realtime Chat**! As the title suggests, it's pretty self-explanatory. But if you're still curious, here's a quick rundown.
You can find it and use on its [website](https://realtime-chat-by-luxiopppp-6b65d680cd47.herokuapp.com).
> Custom domain coming soon™… maybe.

## ✨ What is this project?
This is just a **personal project** I'm building to practice and improve my skills in:

- JavaScript (as main language)
- Node.js & Express (handling the backend logic)
- Socket.io (making real-time communication possible)
- HTML & CSS (basic frontend)

It’s not meant to be a fully polished product but rather a **learning playground** where I can experiment, break things, and (hopefully) fix them again.

## 🤔 Why was this created?
Well, sometimes the best way to learn is by actually building something. This project is all about experimenting, making mistakes, and figuring things out as I go. It's not about perfection—it's about improving my development skills while having fun.

## 🚀 Features
- **Chat rooms** – Create or join existing rooms.
- **Real-time messaging** – No delays, just instant communication *(Unless the internet decides otherwise...)*.
- **User management** – Track users entering and leaving rooms.
- And of course, **the ability to send messages** in the chat rooms!
